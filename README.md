# Onboarding Documentation

This documents onboarding provisions for all roles in the company.

## How To Use This Repo

### Finding provisions for roles/titles
- Open the [`roles`](/roles/) folder
- Open the file that corrisponds to the title of new employee to view provisions needed

### How to Work the Variables
- Just like how variables work in regular coding languages, the variable that is on the lowest row should be the one that should execute over conflicting information.
For Example:
- You can only have one HB1 license
- `const-base` has an HB1 *Teams* license
- `const-dir` has an HB1 *Activity* license
- A Director of Construction's variables would look like:
  - `const-base`
  - `const-dir`
- Since `const-dir` is last on the list, since the HB1 licenses conflict, you will go with whatever the `const-dir` variable says because it is on the last executable line
