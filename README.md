# Onboarding Documentation

This repository defines onboarding standards by job title.

Purpose:
- Document what access, hardware, and accounts each role receives
- Provide a single source of truth for HR, IT, and leadership
- Track changes over time through Git history

This repository does not track onboarding completion.
